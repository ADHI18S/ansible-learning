1st we have to move the key pair from windows to wsl(ubuntu)
#######################
copy the file from windows to wsl
#  copy C:\Users\sadhi\Downloads\network.pem \\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\adhi18s\.ssh\network.pem
set appropriate permission to the file
#  chmod 600 network.pem  

know we can successfully login on wsl ubuntu

##########################################
next step is to without keypair login to the instance

#  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
(this will create a public and private key in windows)

: This command creates a pair of keys (a private key and a public key). The public key will go to your EC2 instances, allowing them to recognize your Windows machine when you try to connect.

-t rsa specifies the type of key (RSA).
-b 2048 specifies the key length (2048 bits, which is secure).


# cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
(copy the public key)

#  ssh -i path/to/your/key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
(login to ec2 instance)

#  nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
(clean all and paste the copied key )
 This opens the authorized_keys file in the Nano text editor, where youâ€™ll paste your public key. This file tells the EC2 instance which public keys are allowed to connect.

Follow-Up:

Paste the Public Key: Right-click and paste the public key you copied earlier.
Save and Exit: Press CTRL + O to save, then CTRL + X to exit.
  
#  chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

 These commands set the correct permissions for security:

chmod 700 ~/.ssh: This makes the .ssh directory only accessible by you (the owner).
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys: This makes the authorized_keys file readable and writable only by you.

# ssh ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
(test )

This command attempts to connect to your EC2 instance without needing to enter a password. If everything is set up correctly, you should connect without a password prompt.
